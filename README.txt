Project Title: Measuring Music Engagement in Real-Time: The Role of Physiological Biomarkers

Course: Smart and Connected Health

---

Project Description:
This project explores how Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data captured from the EmbracePlus wristwatch can be used to assess real-time emotional engagement during music and video playback. The analysis targets both young and older adults, with potential applications in dementia care.
